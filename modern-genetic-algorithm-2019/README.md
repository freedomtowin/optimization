### Genetic Optimization Using Direction-Based Stochastic Search

#### Review of Multi-Offspring Improved Real-Coded Genetic Algorithm (MOIRCGA)

This is a review of a modern genetic algorithm called multi-offspring improved real-coded genetic algorithm (MOIRCGA). The original paper can be found [here](http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2019/4243853.pdf).

 The method used by this algorithm is, formally, called heuristical normal distribution and direction-based crosser (HNDDBX). This algorithm uses generates a direction-based candidate solution and modifies it with some parameterized random variable.

This paper was mainly focused on constrained optimization. This includes linear and non-linear programming problems. Linear programming can be used to find exact solutions for a parameterized function with a set of constraints. However, problems can not always be defined as a parameterized function. For example, if the problem relying on computing some metric on a large dataset, has a large candidate space, or has fewer constraints than parameters, it might be better to use evolutionary strategies.\
