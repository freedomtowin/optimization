# optimization

I have been interesting in particle optimization for some time. I've also been interested in mixed-integer optimization.

Here is a list of some interesting pet projects I have worked on with KernelML:


1.  SVM optimization with a GPU (CUDA)

2. Fitting multiple uniform distributions to a multivariate dataset (Cython)

3. Solving for parameters in a simple BJT transistor circuit (parallel computing with Ray)

4. Non-differentiable activations in spiking networks (parallel computing with Ray)

5. PMT and FGPA Simulation
